# Tasks: JakOlah Real-Time Waste Classification

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-setup/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Tech stack: JavaScript (Next.js 14), FastAPI, Supabase PostgreSQL
   → Structure: Web app with frontend + ML microservice + database
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: WasteItem, Classification, DisposalFacility entities
   → contracts/: classify-frame.md, facilities.md API endpoints
   → quickstart.md: Development workflow and verification steps
3. Generate tasks by user-specified priority:
   → Setup: Project initialization and dependencies
   → Interface: Camera integration and UI components
   → Backend: ML service and API functionality
   → Testing: Manual testing with documented checklist
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Manual testing approach with documentation
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
   → Total: 62 tasks (removed TensorFlow.js and Polish phases)
```

## Notes

- Focus on setup first (T001-T015), then UI/camera (T016-T030), then backend/ML (T031-T052)
- Manual testing approach as specified in plan.md - documented in testing checklist
- Mobile-first development approach throughout all phases
- Privacy-first: no user data storage, local processing when possible
- [P] tasks can be executed in parallel as they modify different files
- TensorFlow.js implementation removed for now - will be added later if needed
- Polish & optimization phase removed - will be addressed in future iterations

## Validation Checklist

- [x] All contracts have corresponding implementation tasks (T014, T015, T042, T046, T047)
- [x] All entities from data-model.md covered (facilities in T009-T010, runtime entities in T024-T028)
- [x] Setup tasks come before implementation (T001-T008 before others)
- [x] UI foundation before specific features (T016-T023 before T024-T037)
- [x] Backend setup before API integration (T038-T045 before T046-T052)
- [x] Testing phase covers all major functionality (T053-T062) with manual approach
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path or component
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files/components)
- [x] Follows user's priority: setup → interface/camera → backend/ML → testing
- [x] Removed optional TensorFlow.js phase per user request
- [x] Removed polish & optimization phase per user request
